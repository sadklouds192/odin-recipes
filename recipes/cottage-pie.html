        <li>¼ pound shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 
            5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and carrot; cook and stir until onion has softened, 
            about 5 minutes. Mix in flour, Italian seasoning, 
            and cinnamon. Stir in parsley.</li>
        <li>Combine beef broth and tomato paste together in a jug; add to beef mixture. 
            Season with salt and pepper; lower heat and simmer for 15 minutes, 
            stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. 
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place diced potatoes in a medium saucepan; 
            cover with water and place over high heat. 
            Bring to a boil and simmer until potatoes are tender, 
            about 15 minutes; drain. Mash potatoes until smooth, 
            then add milk and butter; whip until fluffy. 
            Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon ground beef mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish; 
            spread mashed potatoes on top and sprinkle with grated Cheddar cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until top is browned and cheese is bubbly, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy</li>
